<header><h1>Making Music in Your Heart to the Lord</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start-->
<ol>
    <li>We&rsquo;re not just to love righteousness, but to also hate wickedness [<em>Psa 45:7</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus enjoys music [<em>Psa 45:8</em>].</li>
<!--excerpt.end-->
    <li>The New Jerusalem is the Royal Bride and other capital cities are the Daughters of kings among here honoured women [<em>Psa 45:9</em>].</li>
    <li>We&rsquo;re to sing to one another, but also to sing to the Lord [<em>Eph 5:19</em>].</li>
    <li>Making music to the Lord in one&rsquo;s heart doesn&rsquo;t mean not using instruments. David made music to God in His heart, yet he also used instruments and instituted the use of the same [<em>1Chr 23:5</em>]. His use of instruments didn&rsquo;t
        mean he wasn&rsquo;t making music to God in His heart.</li>
    <li>The instruments help us&mdash;not God in worship. The music is a type of catalyst that helps make music in our hearts.
        <ol>
            <li>The music is an external factor that can affect our hearts/emotions.</li>
            <li>The prophet Elisha was in a foul mood after seeing Joram the son of Ahab and could only prophesy after calling a harpist to play&mdash;obviously to lighten his mood [<em>2Kgs 3:1-19</em>].</li>
            <li>If the music is unpleasant, it can&rsquo;t stir up pleasant emotions, and this would hamper the heart, but if the music is good, it can stir up the right feelings, helping the heart.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>We get filled with the Spirit by speaking to ourselves in Psalms, hymns and spiritual songs [<em>Eph 5 18:19</em>].</li>
    <li>Just as one gets drunk with excess wine and loses control of himself, one can also get filled with the Spirit&mdash;having his faculties taken over by the Spirit [<em>Eph 5:18</em>].</li>
    <li>To be filled with the Spirit doesn&rsquo;t mean one didn&rsquo;t have the Spirit beforehand, but that the Spirit is activated.
        <ol>
            <li>Jesus being in the boat didn&rsquo;t automatically stop the waves, neither did it stop when He awoke, but when He rebuked the waves.</li>
            <li>In the same way, the inactivity of the Spirit doesn&rsquo;t mean the Spirit isn&rsquo;t present, but that it has not been activated.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Doing spiritual activity activates the Spirit.</li>
</ol>
