<header><h1>Are the &ldquo;gods&rdquo; in Psalm 82 the Kings of the Earth?</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start--><p>Some argue that the &ldquo;gods&rdquo; in Psalm 82 are earthly kings. One portion of Scripture used to defend this position is Psalm 89, where God calls David &ldquo;<em>the firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth</em>&rdquo; [<em>Psa 89:27</em>].
    They use this portion to say that since David is the firstborn of God (<em>i.e. a son of God</em>), then other kings of the earth are also sons of God.</p><!--excerpt.end-->
<p>Here are reasons why this is not so:</p>
<ol>
    <li>David was the one who set apart the sons of Asaph for the ministry of prophesying, accompanied by musical instruments [<em>1Chr 25:1</em>].</li>
    <li>Asaph was not just a singer, but he was a seer [<em>2Chr 29:30</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>The things Asaph saw &ndash; like in Psalm 82 were visions, they weren&rsquo;t mere songs, or poetry, they were prophetic visions.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>They are called &ldquo;gods&rdquo; (<em>el</em>)</li>
    <li>&ldquo;<em>Ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princes</em>&rdquo; is what God said to the &ldquo;gods&rdquo;. Therefore, they are not men, nor are they the princes of the earth [<em>Psa 82:7</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>The first death does not kill angels (<em>spirits</em>), but the second death (<em>e. the Lake of Fire</em>) can.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>They are regarded as &ldquo;gods&rdquo; because they are sons of the Most High (<em>God</em>).
        <ol>
            <li>It is for this same reason that Jesus is the Son of God.</li>
            <li>The Jews took Jesus calling Himself the Son of God to mean He was &ldquo;god&rdquo;</li>
            <li>This is not to say that Jesus is equal to these other sons. His point in John 10 was that He&rsquo;s superior to them</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The larger context of Scriptures confirms a council of gods. This shows that those spoken of here are not human kings</li>
    <li>Some say the gods are men, using God&rsquo;s word to David that He is the firstborn of the kings of the earth [<em>Psa 89:20-27</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>Even if earthly kings are called sons of god in some contexts, it doesn&rsquo;t automatically mean that Psalm 82 speaks of earthly kings.</li>
            <li>Even though it is established in history that earthly kings called themselves gods, the Bible does not call earthly kings</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>God judged the gods of Psalm 82
        <ol>
            <li>These gods continued to rule after the judgment, as can be deduced from God&rsquo;s charge to them to defend the weak and fatherless [<em>Psa 82:3</em>]. God didn&rsquo;t tell them &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t defend the weak&rdquo; &ndash; as
                he would if this event occurs at the final judgment, instead, God told them to [go] and defend the weak. Therefore this assembly happened before the final judgment &ndash; which is yet to take place.</li>
            <li>There has never been an assembly of God with the earthly kings, therefore, these aren&rsquo;t human kings.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Some argue the psalm is a prophecy of the future. If this is so, how will God gather unrighteous kings before He arises to judge the earth? What prophecy tells foretells this?
        <ol>
            <li>It will not happen before the Millennium</li>
            <li>It will not happen during the Millennium &ndash; as Isaiah says the kings of the earth would be bound in the abyss in the Millennium [<em>Isa 24:21-23; Rev 20:4</em>]</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Jesus made it clear that the event happened before His time [<em>Joh 10:34-36</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>Claiming to be a human king isn&rsquo;t a claim to be equal to God as the Jews rightly interpreted Jesus&rsquo; words to mean</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>God is to judge the earth, because He will inherit the nations therefore, the &ldquo;sons of god&rdquo; are the current judges of the earth, the current rulers over the nations. If the one who is to rule is god, then so are the ones who currently
        rule.</li>
</ol>
