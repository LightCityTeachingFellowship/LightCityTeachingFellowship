<header><h1>Why Disciples Must Be Made From Every Nation &mdash; Summary</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start-->
<p>It has always been God&rsquo;s plan to save people from every nation&mdash;all the families of the earth [Gen 12:1-3; Mat 28:18-19; Rev 5:9-10].</p>
<!--excerpt.end-->
<p>Why?</p>
<ol>
    <li>Whoever will redeem the earth from the curse of corruption must have authority over all the earth and not just some parts of it.</li>
    <li>The whole earth was originally under the authority of one man, Adam. Now, however, the earth has been divided to all of mankind; it has been divided to the nations [Deut 32:8]. Now, therefore, authority over the earth does not reside in one man but
        in every nation.</li>
    <li>Therefore, for Christ to have authority over all the earth, he has to have authority over all of mankind. In other words, he has to have authority over all the nations.</li>
    <li>However, God&rsquo;s law requires that every nation be ruled by one of its own people [Deut 17:15<em>b</em>].</li>
    <li>Therefore, for Christ to have legitimate authority over all the nations the rulers of the nations have to belong to him and have to be from the nations that they rule over.</li>
    <li>Therefore, for Christ to legitimately rule all the nations, he must make disciples from every one of them. And these disciples will in turn be empowered to be the rulers of their respective nations.</li>
    <li>Thus, through these disciples&rsquo; authority over the nations, Christ will have authority over them and over all the earth. And so, the whole earth will be brought into the glorious liberty of the sons of God [Rom 8:20-21].</li>
