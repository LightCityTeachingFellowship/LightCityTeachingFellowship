<ol>
    <li>The Scripture is the SUREST and ONLY revelation of God.</li>
    <li>Scripture doesn&rsquo;t teach that man can know God by nature, but that certain things about God can be known by nature [<em>Rom 1:19-20</em>].
<!--excerpt.end-->
        <ol>
            <li>The specific things that can be known about Him are:
                <ol>
                    <li>His eternal power and</li>
                    <li>His divine nature.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>We know that God exists, and nature can teach us things about Him, but we CANNOT discover God from nature.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>In the past, men knew God and their hearts weren&rsquo;t darkened [<em>Rom 1:21</em>].</li>
    <li>God doesn&rsquo;t live in man-made temples, not because He&rsquo;s invisible or any other concocted reason, but because He&rsquo;s the Lord of heaven and earth [<em>Acts 17:25</em>].</li>
    <li>&ldquo;<em>that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after Him, and find Him</em>&rdquo; [<em>Acts 17:27</em>] confirms Paul&rsquo;s words that men are blind, because they &ldquo;<em>feel after Him</em>&rdquo;. They &ldquo;<em>feel after Him</em>&rdquo;
        the way the blind grope about unable to see.</li>
    <li>&ldquo;<em>For in Him we live and move and have our being</em>&rdquo; means &ldquo;<em>we are also His offspring</em>&rdquo; [<em>Acts 17:28</em>]. This verse therefore doesn&rsquo;t speak of God&rsquo;s omnipresence.
        <ol>
            <li>The verse teaches that God is our Father</li>
            <li>In the same way, &ldquo;All nations are blessed &lsquo;<strong>IN</strong>&rsquo; Abraham&rdquo; [<em>Gen 12:3</em>] means to be under Abraham&mdash;that is, to be his child [<em>Gal 3:7-8, 29</em>].</li>
            <li>The same applies to Jesus. To be in Jesus is to be His own, His child&mdash;to be under His authority.</li>
            <li>In the same way that &ldquo;<em>that God may be all in all</em>&rdquo; [<em>1Co 15:28</em>] signifies God&rsquo;s supreme authority over all things rather than their absorption into His being, the statement &ldquo;<em>in Him we live and move and have our being</em>&rdquo;
                should be understood as expressing God&rsquo;s sovereignty over creation, not literal indwelling.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The first clear summary of the Kingdom of God is when God said He would make a great nation out of Abraham [<em>Gen 12:2</em>]
        <ol>
            <li>This following is the timeline of the Gospel of the Kingdom
                <ol>
                    <li>Abraham will become a great nation</li>
                    <li>He&rsquo;ll be blessed</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>He will be a blessing</li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <li>God will bless those who bless Abraham (reward of the righteous)</li>
    <li>God will curse those who curse him (Judgment for the sinner)
        <li>Abraham being a blessing is tied to the nation that he becomes [<em>Gen 12:2</em>]</li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <li>As they degraded God&rsquo;s glory/image by exchanging the glory of God for images of men, birds, and reptiles, He gave them over to the degrading of their own bodies [<em>Rom 1:22-27</em>].</li>
</ol>
