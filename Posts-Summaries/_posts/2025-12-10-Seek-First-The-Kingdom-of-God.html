<header><h1>Seek First The Kingdom Of God</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start-->
<ol>
    <li>Despite our needs, our goal should be for Jerusalem to become the praise of the earth i.e., we&rsquo;re to seek God&rsquo;s Kingdom first</li>
<!--excerpt.end-->
    <li>Jesus taught us to pray for God&rsquo;s name to be hallowed&mdash;which doesn&rsquo;t mean to worship God as some suppose&mdash;but it&rsquo;s a prayer for God&rsquo;s name to be revered in all the earth, a thing which will only completely happen
        in the age to come&mdash;after God&rsquo;s Kingdom has come. This is to be our priority.</li>
    <li>This will happen when men see our good works and glorify our heavenly Father
        <ol>
            <li>Men have to see us to be righteous before they can hallow God&rsquo;s name</li>
            <li>If we don&rsquo;t live righteously, our prayer for God&rsquo;s name to be hallowed rings hollow.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>If we want God&rsquo;s will to be done on earth, we have to lead by example, by doing His will on earth.</li>
    <li>We should be the beginning of the prayer for God&rsquo;s will to be done on earth, by practicing His will</li>
    <li>Our goal on earth isn&rsquo;t to make money, buy lands and houses, or live large&mdash;not that these are wrong&mdash;but our objective is to seek the will of God to be done on earth.</li>
</ol>
