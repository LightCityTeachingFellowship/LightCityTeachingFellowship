<header><h1>Why God&rsquo;s Truth is Important</h1></header>

<ol>
    <!--excerpt.start--><li>It is wisdom for the fool to be silent [<em>Job 13:5</em>]
        <ol>
            <li>Don&rsquo;t argue what you don&rsquo;t know, it is better to keep silent</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Don&rsquo;t show God partiality [<em>Job 13:7-11</em>]
        <ol>
            <li>Don&rsquo;t lie or cheat or do evil, even if it&rsquo;s in defence of Him</li>
            <li>The ends do not justify the means with God</li><!--excerpt.end-->
            <li>If he must be defended, it must be with the absolute truth, and with the absolute best methods</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Job&rsquo;s words proved to be true as God didn&rsquo;t take kindly to Eliphaz and his friends trying to defend Him (God) with lies. God was displeased with their testimony, even though they testified in favour of Him [<em>Job 42:7</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>To God, it matters what we teach. It is not sufficient to just defend God, it must be done with the truth,</li>
            <li>This is why knowing the truth of God&rsquo;s word is of the utmost importance.</li>
            <li>Those who care only for turning people to God, but not in using the whole truth to do so, are in danger of God&rsquo;s wrath. God is not pleased when His word is distorted.</li>
            <li>A distortion of God&rsquo;s word is bearing false witness against God</li>
            <li>If it is bad to bear false witness against one&rsquo;s neighbour, it is a much greater sin to do so against God.</li>
            <li>God&rsquo;s wrath was kindled against Job&rsquo;s friends because of this, He will not use a different standard in judging us, or anyone else.</li>
