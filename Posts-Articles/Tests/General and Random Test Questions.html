<h1>How to Make Explanations</h1>
<p>You can explain a thing either by</p>
<ol>
    <li>Defining it in relatively absolute terms,
        <ol>
            <li>A boy is a young or relatively young male member of the human race.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Or/and, by comparing it with some other related idea known to your audience,
        <ol>
            <li>A boy is a human being that is not a girl.</li>
            <li><em>(The above assumes the listener or reader knows what a girl is and what or who is not a girl)</em></li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Or/and, by giving one or more examples of that thing.
        <ol>
            <li>Heritage is a boy, but Christabel his sister is not a boy. Malak is a boy, but Temitope and Obaloluwa are girls. Nathan is a boy, but Isabella is not. She is a girl.</li>
            <li><em>The above will only work if the listener or reader knows the people mentioned above.</em></li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Or/and, by listing known or observable attributes
        <ol>
            <li>Boys are usually more rough in their play, usually eat more than girls, usually less socially aware and sensitive than girls. Boys, compared to girls, don&rsquo;t mature as fast because they are usually less socially and emotionally aware
                and intelligent than girls.</li>
            <li><em>Such definitions as above, may be subjective and tainted by opinion.</em></li>
