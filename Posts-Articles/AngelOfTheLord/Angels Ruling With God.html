<h1>Scriptures Showing God Ruling With His Angels</h1>
<ol>
    <!--excerpt.start--><li>Orchestrating the death of Ahab at Ramoth Gilead [1Kin 22:19-23]
        <ol>
            <li>Yahweh&rsquo;s hosts surround Him and he asks them for suggestions on how to get Ahab to Ramoth-Gilead to die there.</li>
            <li>They gave different suggestions and he decided which one would work and gave command for it to be carried out.</li><!--excerpt.end-->
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The trials of Job [Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7]
        <ol>
            <li>Angels, called &ldquo;the sons of God&rdquo;, present themselves to God.</li>
            <li>God&rsquo;s testimony about Job being righteous is contradicted by the Satan and put to the test.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>God presiding over the assembly of gods and judging them for mismanaging the earth [Psa 82:1-7].
        <ol>
            <li>It is God who made them &ldquo;gods&rdquo;, He called them his sons&mdash;&ldquo;sons of the Most High&rdquo; [Psa 82:6]</li>
            <li>They are not mortals as they evidently do not die as men [Psa 82:6-7].</li>
            <li>Apparently, since that is what He judges them for failing to do, they were appointed by Him over the earth to administer justice and maintain good order [Psa 82:3-4]</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Isaiah&rsquo;s Commission [Isa 6:1-8]
        <ol>
            <li>Yahweh acknowledges others as ruling with him and asks who he will send for them&mdash;&ldquo;Who will go for <strong>us</strong>?&rdquo;.</li>
            <li>Although, except for the seraphim, we do not find any direct reference to angels here, based on other Scriptures, it is the other members of His government, though inferior to him, that he is referring.</li>
            <li>Isaiah was sent. And from this we can see that prophets, though servants of God, are appointed by God and His government, His heavenly council.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Creation [Gen 1:26; 2:18; 3:22]
        <ol>
            <li>Yahweh was not alone at creation but made the world under his government.</li>
            <li>&ldquo;Let <strong>US </strong>make man&hellip;&rdquo; [Gen 1:26]</li>
            <li>&ldquo;It is not good for the man to be alone, let <strong>US </strong>make a helper suitable for him&rdquo; [Gen 2:18LXX/ABP]</li>
            <li>&ldquo;The man has become like one of <strong>US</strong>, knowing good and evil&hellip;&rdquo; [Gen 3:22]</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The division of nations at Babel [Gen 11:7]
        <ol>
            <li>The account of the division of men into nations at Babel shows that God does not rule alone.</li>
            <li>This account contrasts men&rsquo;s &ldquo;Let <strong>us</strong>&rdquo; and Yahweh God&rsquo;s &ldquo;Let <strong>us</strong>&rdquo;. From this contrast, since men&rsquo;s &ldquo;us&rdquo; is not a few men but many, we can see that Yahweh&rsquo;s
                &ldquo;<strong>us</strong>&rdquo; is not just two or three persons but many angels.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>However, I think the clearest account is in Daniel and I am referring to the account of how Nebuchadnezzar was humbled [Dan 4].</p>
<h1>Insights From the Account of the Judgment of Nebuchadnezzar [Dan 4]</h1>
<p>Though this account emphasizes the Sovereignty of God over all the earth, it very clearly teaches that</p>
<ol>
    <li>God does not rule alone but rules with his angels, the holy ones.</li>
    <li>God, together with His angels, the Holy Ones, makes decrees such as those concerning who rules the nations.</li>
    <li><strong><span>Quite significantly, the decree against Nebuchadnezzar was described as being both of God and of the angels</span></strong>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The decree of Most High </strong>[Dan 4:24], and also,</li>
            <li><strong>The decree of the watchers and the word of the holy ones </strong>[Dan 4:17].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><span><strong>And the One ruling is identified as God and also identified as all of heaven</strong></span>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>God Most High</strong>[Dan 4:25,32,34].
                <ol>
                    <li>It is God Most High who is described as ruling over the kingdom of men and gives it to whomsoever he will [Dan 4:25].</li>
                    <li>This is even though we clearly know from the same account that angels&mdash;the watchers and the holy ones&mdash;are very active in His rule.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>And also, <em>all of </em>heaven</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>&ldquo;&hellip;thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that <strong><u>the heavens do rule</u></strong>.&rdquo; [Dan 4:26]</li>
                    <li>Heaven is made up, not only of God Most High, but of other inhabitants as well. Therefore, saying heaven rules is saying God and the angels rule.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding all this, we can say with Hebrews that this world is under the rule of angels [Heb 2:5]. We can also describe every previous word that has been spoken as the word of angels [Heb 2:2].</p>
